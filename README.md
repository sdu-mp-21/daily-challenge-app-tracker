## What is it
This application was created to solve problems that often arise in humans.
A person basically wants to become a little better than yesterday,
and at some point he thinks about his habits that he commits during the day.

We have developed an application that will check (track) whether the habit that
he set himself will be fulfilled. For more motivation, we have developed a system of social networks. 
Each person will be able to publish their results, and start discussing about this.

# 
If you lose your phone, a person can easily restore their data on a Nav device.
